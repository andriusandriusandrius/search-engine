Coffee Brewing Techniques

Brewing great coffee requires proper extraction of flavors from the beans. Methods like pour-over, French press, and espresso create different brewing profiles. Water temperature and grind size strongly influence taste and aroma. Freshly roasted beans offer richer flavors and better crema. Experimenting with ratios helps achieve a balanced and enjoyable cup.
