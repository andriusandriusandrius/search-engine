Ocean Ecosystems

Oceans cover most of Earth’s surface and contain diverse ecosystems. Coral reefs host thousands of marine species and depend on stable water temperatures. Deep-sea environments feature organisms adapted to extreme pressure and darkness. Ocean currents regulate global climate and nutrient distribution. Human impact such as pollution and overfishing threatens marine biodiversity.
