The Art of Photography

Photography blends technical skill with artistic expression. Shutter speed, ISO, and aperture form the exposure triangle. Composition techniques like rule of thirds and leading lines guide the viewer’s eye. Lighting dramatically changes the mood of a scene. Digital editing tools enable enhancements and creative manipulation.
