Medieval European Warfare

Medieval warfare involved knights, castles, and complex feudal alliances. Armor evolved from chainmail to full plate over several centuries. Siege engines such as trebuchets and battering rams were essential for attacking fortifications. Naval battles increased as coastal cities gained influence. Gunpowder eventually transformed tactics and reduced the dominance of armored cavalry.
