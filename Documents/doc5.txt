The History of Writing Systems

Early writing systems emerged in Mesopotamia and Egypt around 3000 BCE. Cuneiform and hieroglyphics recorded trade, rituals, and governance. Over time, alphabets evolved to represent individual sounds, making literacy more accessible. Writing enabled the preservation of laws, stories, and scientific knowledge. Today, digital communication dominates how humans record information.
