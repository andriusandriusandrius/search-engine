Space Exploration History

Space exploration began with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 by the Soviet Union. This milestone marked the beginning of the space age. NASA followed with crewed missions such as the Apollo program, which landed humans on the Moon in 1969. Modern missions include Mars rovers, deep-space telescopes, and reusable rockets. Private companies have accelerated innovation in orbital and planetary exploration.
